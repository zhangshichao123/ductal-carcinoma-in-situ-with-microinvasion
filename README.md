# Image fusion of H&E-stained and MPM images

This code is for the image fusion part of paper “A novel method for rapid and accurate diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion by fusing H&E-stained images and multiphoton microscopy images”

## Tips:<br>
1.	Cell nucleus segmentation can be performed using the Hover-Net model.（https://github.com/vqdang/hover_net）<br>
2.	The "imgs" folder contains a pair of matched H&E stained images and MPM images of DCISM and DCIS, respectively, as a demonstration example.<br>
3.	The "pred" folder contains cell nucleus segmentation masks generated by Hover-Net on H&E stained images.<br>
4.	Running "use.ipynb" can generate fused images by fusing cell nuclei in H&E stained images and MPM images.<br>
